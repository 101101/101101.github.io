												<h3>Description: </h3>
												The document management solution that we had was "big," it cost a lot of money, and we didn't have a need to leverage more than ~40% of its capability. We often found ourselves questioning why we continued use it... Oh yeah, we were "locked in."  
											</p>
											<p>
												We wanted to find a solution which <u>cost less</u>, was fairly <u>simple to use</u>, had <u>version control</u>, <u>integrated</u> with our existing systems, and could be used for runbooks and other knowledge articles in response to alerts from our monitoring systems; bonus points if it was able to be <u>directly linked</u> from alerts or notifications.

										<h3>What did we do? </h3>
										I looked at several other document management systems, and while nearly all of them were cheaper, they all still required more complexity than I thought we needed to achieve the goal.
									</p>
									<p>
										Then I started thinking... GitHub has version control, it's accessible via API, you can run queries against it, and the only different in document formatting was a move to Markdown, which most of us were already embracing with code documentation. And the best part? It's a solution we're already paying for... so, it was essentially "free."
									</p>
									<p>
										So, I searched a bit for a snazzy front-end to put on it (<a href="https://github.com/vsoch/docsy-jekyll">docsy-jeckyll</a>), modified the backend code to fit our document structure, and setup a pilot.
									</p>
									<hr>
									<p>
										<h3>What was the outcome? </h3>
										The pilot was an immense success!
										<ol>
											<li>- We were able to send alerts with variable direct links to runbooks, or send variable links that would perform searches for runbooks</li>
											<li>- The cost was $0 and the savings of not renewing our other document solution was tens of thousands</li>
											<li>- It was simple to use, since we already used Markdown</li>
											<li>- It is version controlled</li>
											<li>- We can easily integrate it with other solutions since it lives in GitHub </li>
										</ol>

										<h3>What are the benefits? </h3>
										Unfortunately, we'd missed a 1 or a 0 <i>(or several)</i> somewhere, because the hose would blotch 
										out from time to time, and the exploding creatures were more like a pixelated blocks than the 
										expected KA-BOOM that we expected. But, the game worked! We played that thing for hours...
